# The option below identifies how the ProxyList is treated.
# only one option should be uncommented at time,
# otherwise the last appearing option will be accepted
#
#dynamic_chain
#
# Dynamic - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list
# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain
# (dead proxies are skipped)
# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app
#
strict_chain
#
# Strict - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list
# all proxies must be online to play in chain
# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app
#
#round_robin_chain
#
# Round Robin - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# of chain_len length
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list
# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain
# (dead proxies are skipped).
# the start of the current proxy chain is the proxy after the last
# proxy in the previously invoked proxy chain.
# if the end of the proxy chain is reached while looking for proxies
# start at the beginning again.
# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app
# These semantics are not guaranteed in a multithreaded environment.
#
#random_chain
#
# Random - Each connection will be done via random proxy
# (or proxy chain, see  chain_len) from the list.
# this option is good to test your IDS :)

# Proxy DNS requests - no leak for DNS data
proxy_dns 

# set the class A subnet number to use for the internal remote DNS mapping
# we use the reserved 224.x.x.x range by default,
# if the proxified app does a DNS request, we will return an IP from that range.
# on further accesses to this ip we will send the saved DNS name to the proxy.
# in case some control-freak app checks the returned ip, and denies to 
# connect, you can use another subnet, e.g. 10.x.x.x or 127.x.x.x.
# of course you should make sure that the proxified app does not need
# *real* access to this subnet. 
# i.e. dont use the same subnet then in the localnet section
#remote_dns_subnet 127 
#remote_dns_subnet 10
remote_dns_subnet 224

### Examples for localnet exclusion
## localnet ranges will *not* use a proxy to connect.
## Exclude connections to 192.168.1.0/24 with port 80
# localnet 192.168.1.0:80/255.255.255.0

## Exclude connections to 192.168.100.0/24
# localnet 192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0

## Exclude connections to ANYwhere with port 80
# localnet 0.0.0.0:80/0.0.0.0

## RFC5735 Loopback address range
## if you enable this, you have to make sure remote_dns_subnet is not 127
## you'll need to enable it if you want to use an application that 
## connects to localhost.
# localnet 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

## RFC1918 Private Address Ranges
# localnet 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
# localnet 172.16.0.0/255.240.0.0
# localnet 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0

# Example 1: Your corporate network admin is the BOFH.  You're not officially
#   allowed access to the internet.  But you've found a sequence of proxies
#   setup to connect the various internal networks, with one of them having
#   internet access.

# http   172.16.30.10	8080
# http   10.10.5.4	80
#
# Example 2: Suppose you have access to several fast caching proxies and you
#   want to load balance connections across them.  Since they're fast, they
#   shouldn't need large timeouts.  If one of them happens to go down, it will
#   be removed from the active list and each connect() will use the next proxy,
#   going back to the beginning once the end is reached.
# [LoadBalanceList]
# round_robin_chain
# max_chain = 1
# tcp_read_time_out 2000
# tcp_connect_time_out 1000
# http	192.168.89.2	8080
# http	192.168.89.3	8080
# http	192.168.89.4	8080
# http	192.168.89.5	8080
#
# Example 3: We're doing some scraping again the wishes of our target, so we
#   come at him from all sides. But since we're using random free proxies found
#   on the web, many of the proxies are slow an unreliable.  Give a larger
#   timeout to account for this.  The broken/dead ones will be removed as they
#   are encountered and we'll cycle through each live proxy sequentially per
#   connect().
